### This project is a work in progress.

Information and code contained in this repository should be considered provisional and a work in progress, and not the final implementation for the HMDA Platform Auth components, unless otherwise indicated.

## Introduction to HMDA

The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) requires many financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose information about mortgages. HMDA was originally enacted by Congress in 1975 and is implemented by Regulation C. The Dodd-Frank Act transferred HMDA rulemaking authority from the Federal Reserve Board to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on July 21, 2011.

This regulation provides the public loan data that can be used to assist:

- in determining whether financial institutions are serving the housing needs of their communities;
- public officials in distributing public-sector investments so as to attract private investment to areas where it is needed;
- and in identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns.

This regulation applies to certain financial institutions, including banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other mortgage lending institutions.
